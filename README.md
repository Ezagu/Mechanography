# 🧠 Mechanography - Typing Speed Game

## 🎯 What is it?

**Mechanography** is a web-based typing speed test app inspired by [10fastfingers.com](https://10fastfingers.com/typing-test/english). The goal is to type as many correct words as possible within a set time, improving both your speed and accuracy.

## 🚀 Why I built it

I created this project as part of my journey to learn **JavaScript** and explore its core functionalities:

- DOM manipulation
- Keyboard event handling
- Timers (`setInterval`)
- Word comparison and scoring logic
- Interactive styling with CSS

It was also an opportunity to practice code organization, responsive layout, and user experience.

2. Press **Enter** or click the **Reset** button to start.
3. A list of random words appears.
4. As you type:
   - Incorrect letters are highlighted.
   - Words are submitted with the spacebar.

## 🧠 Inspiration

I was inspired by the classic typing test on [10fastfingers.com](https://10fastfingers.com/typing-test/english), which helped me improve my typing skills as a developer.

I wanted to replicate its basic dynamic as a personal challenge to practice web development from scratch.
